# SeekNet - Chrome Extension Frontend
## What is this?
SeekNet is a way to create and discover connections among webpages. Opening the extension on a webpage displays a list of created outgoing connections with their respective descriptions. Clicking a connection will open a new tab at the connected URL. 

Currently, all connections are user-created. To add a connection to a webpage, open the extension on the webpage and add the connection URL and description. Then click "Create Connection". Your connection should then appear in the list of connections for that current webpage.

In essence, SeekNet helps you discover where to go next.
